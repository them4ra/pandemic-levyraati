# Pandemic Levyraati
In the beginning of 2020 the whole world locked down and people were not able to leave their homes. During this time, me and two friends began meeting on Saturdays via videochat and rated songs. After doing this for one night and keeping score on an Excel sheet, I thought it would be a cool exercise to create a CRUD application in PHP and MySQL to keep score of the ratings we gave songs. 

I began learning PHP and cobbled the appliation together in a couple of afternoons. Once we tried the site out the next Saturday, it became a hit and we have kept using it ever since. In three years we have rated almost 7000 songs.

The site has been developed ever since, with features being added as users have asked for them. Given that I had no idea we would be using this site for so long or that I would even need to upkeep it, the code is sloppy and spaghettified to a ludicrous degree. I have added features usually while rating songs with my friends, so there was no attempt to do things the "right" way: all we cared about was getting a feature to work. 

I am sharing this not to be some shining example of a coding project, but the exact opposite. I want to show you a project I worked on for years on my spare time that I spent little time worrying about writing code consistently or using best practises. I wanted to create something that works and that my friends could use. Instead of being paralyzed by fear of making mistakes and not writing code properly, I just sat down and wrote something.  

This is the only coding project I worked on in my free time that was directly useful to others and despite it being a mess, it has a special place in my heart. I learned so much working on this site and will know what mistakes to look out for in the future because I made them all here.  

# Features that have been added over the years
